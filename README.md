Before you start writing or committing code, please follow these steps to ensure your work is in sync with the latest updates from the team:

     ```bash
     git branch
     ```

2. **Pull Latest Changes from Main**:

   - Switch to the `main` branch and pull the latest changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

3. **Update Your Working Branch**:

   - Switch back to your working branch and merge the changes from the `main` branch into it:
     ```bash
     git checkout your-feature-branch
     git merge main
     ```

4. **Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any)**:

   - If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them promptly and ensure that your code runs correctly.

5. **Continue Your Development Work**:
   - Once everything is in order, continue developing on your branch.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your working branch includes the latest changes from the team, reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts and improving collaboration efficiency.

### Tailwind CSS Successfully Added

I have successfully integrated Tailwind CSS into the project. Please follow the steps below to configure and use it:

1. **Modify CSS Settings**

   Open and edit the `static/css/styles.css` file to add or modify styles as needed.

2. **Run Tailwind CLI**

   In the root directory of your project, run the following command to process and generate the final CSS file:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss -i ./static/css/styles.css -o ./static/css/output.css --watch
   ```

   This command will watch for changes in the `styles.css` file and automatically update the `output.css` file.

3. **Include the Generated CSS in HTML**

   In your HTML file, add the following code to include the generated CSS file:

   ```html
   <link
     href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/output.css') }}"
     rel="stylesheet"
   />
   ```

   This ensures that your HTML file uses the styles generated by Tailwind CSS.

By following these steps, you have successfully integrated Tailwind CSS into your project and can start using its powerful features to design and develop your web pages.
